Depression in elderly adults is a persistent feeling of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest that lasts for weeks or longer and affects daily life. It's important to understand that depression is not a normal part of aging, though it can be more common in older adults due to various life changes, health conditions, or losses. Depression is a real medical condition that can be treated, not a character flaw or weakness.

Symptoms include persistent sadness, anxiety, or feeling empty, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, difficulty concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of death or suicide. These symptoms persist most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks.

For wheelchair users, depression can have significant impacts on health and daily functioning. Motivation for important self-care practices like skin checks or healthy eating may decrease. There's less interest in activities and social connections, which can lead to isolation. Energy levels are already limited by mobility challenges, and depression can further reduce available energy.

Daily considerations include staying connected with family and friends, maintaining routines, seeking professional help, engaging in gentle activities you once enjoyed, and understanding that depression is treatable. Small steps matter. If you're experiencing persistent symptoms that interfere with daily life or having thoughts of self-harm, it's crucial to reach out for professional help. Healthcare providers and mental health professionals can provide treatment and support. Depression is not something you have to face alone, and effective treatments are available.
