Chronic joint pain refers to ongoing pain in your joints that lasts for weeks, months, or longer. This persistent pain can affect one or multiple joints and can significantly impact your ability to perform daily activities comfortably. Unlike occasional aches that come and go, chronic pain becomes a regular part of daily life.

Symptoms typically include aching or throbbing in the affected joints, stiffness that makes movement difficult, pain that worsens with activity, and sometimes a feeling of weakness. The pain can be constant or come and go, but it tends to persist over time.

For wheelchair users, chronic joint pain can affect many aspects of daily life. Pushing your wheelchair may become painful if your shoulders, elbows, or wrists are affected. Transfers can be challenging and may require more careful movement and possibly assistance. Reaching for items, opening doors, or performing other daily tasks may be limited by pain. The cumulative effect of pain throughout the day can also lead to fatigue.

Daily considerations include pacing your activities throughout the day, using assistive devices like reachers to reduce joint strain, allowing extra time for activities, and taking rest breaks when needed. Energy conservation becomes important - save your strength for activities that matter most. If chronic joint pain is interfering significantly with your daily life or suddenly worsens, consider discussing your situation with a healthcare professional who can help you explore strategies for living well with chronic pain.
