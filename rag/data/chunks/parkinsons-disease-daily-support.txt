Parkinson's disease is a progressive condition that affects the nervous system and primarily impacts movement. It develops gradually, often starting with mild symptoms that become more noticeable over time. The condition occurs when certain nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical important for movement, become damaged or die.

Common symptoms include tremors or shaking, often starting in one hand, muscle stiffness or rigidity that makes movement feel difficult, slow movement that can make simple tasks take longer, problems with balance and coordination that increase fall risk, and sometimes changes in speech, writing, or cognitive function. Symptoms typically begin on one side of the body and may eventually affect both sides.

For wheelchair users with Parkinson's, several specific challenges arise. Fine movements needed for tasks like buttoning clothes or using devices can become difficult due to tremors and stiffness. Transfers may be slower and require extra care due to rigidity and balance issues. Some people experience "freezing," where they temporarily can't initiate movement, which can be particularly challenging during transfers or when trying to move. Medication timing becomes important, as symptoms may be better controlled at certain times of day.

Daily considerations include allowing extra time for all activities, ensuring safety during transfers with support available, taking medications at consistent times as prescribed, using adaptive tools if fine motor skills are affected, and staying as active as possible within your abilities. Regular neurological care helps manage symptoms and adjust treatments as needed. If you're having safety concerns, experiencing significant changes in symptoms, or need help managing daily activities, your healthcare team can provide specialized support and strategies.
