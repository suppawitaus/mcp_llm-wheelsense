Your arms and shoulders do a lot of work every day when you use your wheelchair, so keeping them strong and flexible is essential. Upper body exercises help maintain muscle strength, improve range of motion, and can reduce your risk of injury.

The good news is that you can do many effective exercises right in your wheelchair. Simple movements like arm circles, shoulder shrugs, and reaching exercises work well. You can lift your arms overhead, stretch them out to the sides, or bring them across your body - these movements help maintain flexibility in your shoulders and upper back.

Stretching exercises are also important. Gentle stretches can help prevent tightness and discomfort. Try reaching one arm up and over your head, holding for 15 to 30 seconds, then switching sides. You can also try gentle neck rolls and shoulder rolls to keep those areas mobile.

Proper form matters - move slowly and smoothly, don't force movements that cause pain, and breathe naturally throughout your exercises. If something hurts, stop and try a gentler movement. Start with a few repetitions and gradually increase as you build strength. Building a routine gradually helps prevent injury and makes exercise more sustainable. Even five to ten minutes of upper body movement each day can make a real difference.
