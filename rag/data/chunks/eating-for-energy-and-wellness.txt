The food you eat directly fuels your daily activities. When you choose nutritious foods, you're providing your body with the energy it needs to move, think clearly, and function at its best throughout the day.

Protein is particularly important because it helps maintain and build muscle. Since wheelchair users rely heavily on their upper body strength, getting enough protein from sources like chicken, fish, eggs, beans, or dairy products helps keep your muscles strong and healthy. Aim to include protein in each meal.

Carbohydrates are your body's primary source of energy. Choose complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, which provide steady, lasting energy rather than the quick spike and crash you might get from sugary foods. These complex carbs break down slowly, keeping you energized longer.

Eating patterns that support consistent energy include having regular meals and snacks, starting your day with a good breakfast, and not going too long without eating. Listen to your body's hunger signals - if you feel hungry, eat. If you feel tired or sluggish, consider whether you've eaten enough or if your meals have been balanced. Your body knows what it needs, so pay attention to how different foods make you feel.
