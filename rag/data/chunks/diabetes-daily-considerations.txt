Diabetes is a condition where your body has difficulty managing blood sugar levels. This happens when your body either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't use insulin effectively. Insulin is a hormone that helps your body use sugar from food for energy. When blood sugar isn't well managed, it can affect many parts of your body over time.

Common symptoms include increased thirst and drinking more fluids than usual, frequent urination, feeling tired or fatigued even when you've had enough rest, wounds or cuts that heal slowly, blurred vision, and sometimes increased hunger. These symptoms can develop gradually, so they might not be immediately noticeable.

For wheelchair users, diabetes requires particular attention to several areas. Skin care becomes especially critical because high blood sugar can affect circulation and healing, making pressure sores and other skin injuries more serious and slower to heal. Foot care is extremely important because reduced sensation in the feet can make injuries go unnoticed, and poor circulation can delay healing. Energy levels may fluctuate throughout the day based on blood sugar levels, affecting your ability to perform activities.

Daily considerations include eating regular meals at consistent times, monitoring blood sugar levels as recommended, performing thorough daily skin inspections since wounds heal slowly, paying special attention to foot care and inspection, and staying well-hydrated. Regular medical monitoring is essential. If you have wounds that aren't healing, notice changes in sensation, especially in your feet, or have concerns about managing your diabetes, consult with your healthcare team. They can help you develop a management plan that works for your lifestyle.
