Good posture in your wheelchair affects both your comfort and your health. When you sit with proper alignment, you reduce strain on your body and help prevent problems like back pain, shoulder issues, and pressure sores.

Elements of good seated posture include sitting with your back against the backrest, feet flat on footrests, knees at about the same height as your hips, and your head positioned comfortably above your shoulders rather than leaning too far forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed, not hunched up toward your ears.

Posture affects your comfort because when your body is well-aligned, muscles don't have to work as hard to hold you up. It also affects your health by helping distribute your weight more evenly, which reduces pressure on any single area. Good posture also makes it easier to breathe deeply and can improve your circulation.

You can improve your posture by using wheelchair adjustments effectively. Make sure your backrest height supports your whole back, adjust footrests so your feet are supported comfortably, and use cushions or pillows to fill gaps and provide support where needed. Check your posture throughout the day - it's easy to slip into less ideal positions without noticing, so regular reminders can help.
