Pressure sores, also called pressure injuries, are areas of damaged skin and tissue that develop when constant pressure cuts off blood flow to a particular area of your body. This happens because your body weight presses down on the same spots for too long.

When you sit in your wheelchair, certain areas bear most of your weight. These include your tailbone, hips, and heels. Without adequate blood flow, the skin and underlying tissue can become damaged. The longer the pressure continues, the more serious the damage can become.

Early warning signs are important to recognize. Look for redness that doesn't go away after you shift position, areas of skin that feel warmer or cooler than surrounding skin, and any unusual discomfort or pain in spots where you usually feel pressure. Sometimes the skin might look different in color or texture.

The good news is that pressure sores are largely preventable. Paying attention to these early signs and taking action right away can make a big difference. If you notice any of these warning signs, it's important to address them quickly. Regular position changes and proper skin care are your best defenses against developing pressure sores.
