Heart disease refers to various conditions that affect how your heart works and how blood circulates through your body. This can include conditions that affect the heart muscle, blood vessels, heart rhythm, or heart valves. Heart disease is common, especially as people age, and it can range from mild to more serious conditions.

Common symptoms may include shortness of breath, especially with activity or when lying flat, chest discomfort or pressure, feeling unusually tired or fatigued, swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet, feeling lightheaded or dizzy, and sometimes heart palpitations or irregular heartbeat. Symptoms can vary widely depending on the specific type of heart condition and how severe it is.

For wheelchair users, heart disease can affect daily life in several ways. Your endurance may be reduced, making activities that once felt manageable now feel more tiring. Breathing difficulties can make pushing your wheelchair or doing transfers more challenging. You may need to pace yourself more carefully, taking breaks more frequently. Circulation issues can contribute to swelling in the legs and feet, which may require elevation.

Daily considerations include conserving energy by breaking activities into smaller steps, recognizing early signs of tiredness and taking breaks, elevating your legs when sitting if swelling occurs, and moving gradually rather than rushing. Know your own limits and respect them. If you experience new or worsening symptoms like chest pain or pressure, severe shortness of breath, significant swelling, or other concerning changes, seek medical attention promptly. Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider help monitor your heart health and manage conditions effectively.
