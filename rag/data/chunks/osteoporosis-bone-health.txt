Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become weaker and more fragile, making them more likely to break even from minor falls or impacts. This happens when bones lose density over time, which is more common as people age, especially in women after menopause.

Often, there are no obvious symptoms until a fracture occurs. Some people may notice they've lost height over time, experience back pain, or develop a stooped posture. Unfortunately, many people don't know they have osteoporosis until they break a bone from what seems like a minor incident.

For wheelchair users, osteoporosis presents specific concerns. Transfers in and out of your wheelchair carry a higher risk if bones are fragile, making safe transfer techniques even more important. Falls are a serious concern because weak bones can break more easily. Even bumps or sudden movements during transfers can potentially cause fractures.

Daily considerations focus on safety and prevention. Use careful, controlled movements during transfers rather than sudden or jerky motions. Ensure you have good support and assistance when needed. Pay attention to cushioning and padding in your wheelchair. Avoid activities that involve sudden movements or potential impacts. Some people find it helpful to work with a therapist to learn the safest transfer techniques. If you experience a fall, even if you don't feel immediate pain, or if you notice persistent back pain or changes in your posture, consult a healthcare professional to discuss your bone health.
