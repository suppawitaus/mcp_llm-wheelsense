Arthritis refers to inflammation in your joints that can cause pain, stiffness, and reduced ability to move comfortably. This condition is common, especially as people age, and it can affect various joints throughout the body including hands, wrists, shoulders, hips, and knees.

Common symptoms include joint pain that may feel achy or sharp, stiffness that's often worse in the morning or after periods of rest, reduced range of motion that makes it harder to move joints fully, and sometimes swelling or warmth around affected joints. The severity can vary from day to day, with some days being better than others.

For wheelchair users, arthritis can create additional challenges. Transferring in and out of your wheelchair may become more difficult if your shoulders, hips, or knees are affected. Pushing your wheelchair can strain arthritic hands, wrists, and shoulders. Reaching for items or performing daily tasks may be more painful or limited.

Daily considerations include moving your joints gently and regularly to prevent stiffness, avoiding overexertion that might worsen pain, using good posture and positioning to reduce joint strain, and allowing yourself extra time for activities. Some people find that gentle range of motion exercises in the morning help reduce stiffness. If you experience persistent severe pain or significant loss of mobility that interferes with your daily activities, it's important to discuss your concerns with a healthcare professional.
