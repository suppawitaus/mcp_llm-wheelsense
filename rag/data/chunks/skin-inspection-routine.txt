Daily skin checks are an essential part of taking care of yourself. By looking at your skin regularly, you can catch any problems early, before they become more serious. Making this a daily habit takes just a few minutes but can prevent major issues down the road.

The best time to check your skin is usually at the end of the day, perhaps as part of your bedtime routine, or in the morning after you get up. You'll want to look at all the areas where pressure occurs - your tailbone, hips, heels, and any other spots where your body contacts your wheelchair or bed.

Since some areas are hard to see yourself, a mirror can be very helpful. A handheld mirror works well for checking your backside and other hard-to-see spots. Some people also find it helpful to ask a family member or caregiver to help with areas that are difficult to reach or see.

What should you look for? Check for any redness, especially redness that doesn't go away when you press on it, changes in skin color or texture, areas that feel unusually warm or cool, and any broken skin or sores. Keep your skin clean and dry as part of your daily routine, as moisture can increase the risk of skin problems. If you notice anything concerning during your checks, don't wait - seek attention right away.
