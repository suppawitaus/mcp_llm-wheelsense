COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a term that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. These are long-term lung conditions that make it difficult to breathe by narrowing airways and damaging lung tissue. The condition develops gradually and is typically progressive, meaning it may worsen over time, though the rate varies from person to person.

Common symptoms include shortness of breath that's particularly noticeable during physical activity, persistent coughing that may produce mucus, frequent respiratory infections, wheezing or a whistling sound when breathing, fatigue and reduced energy levels, and sometimes tightness in the chest. Symptoms often worsen during flare-ups or when exposed to irritants like smoke or strong odors.

For wheelchair users with COPD, breathing difficulties significantly impact daily life. Pushing your wheelchair may become very difficult, potentially requiring assistance or motorized options. Transfers can leave you short of breath, requiring rest periods afterward. The reduced lung capacity means you have less energy overall. Some people require supplemental oxygen, which adds considerations for equipment and activity planning.

Daily considerations include pacing all activities and taking frequent rest breaks, learning breathing techniques, avoiding triggers like smoke or strong chemicals, using supplemental oxygen as prescribed, and conserving energy by breaking tasks into smaller steps. Work within your breathing capacity rather than pushing beyond it. Regular respiratory care helps manage the condition. If you experience worsening symptoms, increased difficulty breathing, or concerns about your oxygen needs, consult your healthcare team promptly, as prompt treatment of flare-ups can help prevent serious complications.
