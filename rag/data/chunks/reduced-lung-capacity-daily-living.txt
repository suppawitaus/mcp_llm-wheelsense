Reduced lung capacity means your lungs aren't able to take in as much air or exchange oxygen as efficiently as they once could. This can happen due to various conditions, age-related changes, or previous lung damage. When lung capacity is reduced, your body receives less oxygen, which can significantly affect your energy levels and ability to perform physical activities.

Symptoms include shortness of breath with activities, feeling tired more easily, difficulty completing tasks that require physical effort, needing to rest frequently, and sometimes feeling like you can't take a deep breath. These symptoms can be frustrating, as activities that once felt manageable may now feel overwhelming.

For wheelchair users, reduced lung capacity affects daily life in important ways. Physical exertion, including pushing your wheelchair, becomes more limited and tiring. Simple transfers may leave you breathless and require recovery time. The overall reduction in energy affects your ability to participate in activities or complete daily tasks. You may find yourself needing to choose which activities are most important because your energy is limited.

Daily considerations include breaking all tasks into smaller steps, taking rest breaks before becoming exhausted, positioning yourself to maximize breathing capacity, planning your day to allow for recovery time, and prioritizing activities that matter most. It's helpful to plan activities for times when you typically feel best. Some people find that certain positions make breathing easier. If you experience persistent or worsening breathing difficulties, concerns about your oxygen levels, or if reduced lung capacity is significantly limiting your daily activities, discussing these concerns with a healthcare professional can help you explore strategies to optimize your breathing and quality of life.
