Changing your position regularly is one of the most important things you can do to keep your skin healthy. When you shift your weight, you relieve pressure on areas that have been bearing your body weight, allowing fresh blood flow to reach those spots.

Experts generally recommend shifting your position at least every 15 to 30 minutes when you're sitting. This might sound like a lot, but it doesn't have to be complicated. Simple weight shifts work well - leaning forward slightly, leaning to one side, then the other, or using any movement that takes pressure off your sitting bones and tailbone.

Many people find it helpful to set reminders, whether that's a timer on your phone, an alarm clock, or associating position changes with other routine activities like taking a sip of water or checking the time. Some wheelchairs have features like tilt or recline functions that can help with pressure relief too.

The key is consistency. Making position changes a regular habit throughout your day helps prevent pressure from building up over time. Even small shifts every 20 to 30 minutes can make a significant difference. Find a routine that works for you and stick with it.
