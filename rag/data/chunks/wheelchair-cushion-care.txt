A good wheelchair cushion is one of your most important tools for preventing pressure sores and staying comfortable. The right cushion helps distribute your weight more evenly and reduces pressure on vulnerable areas.

It's important to check your cushion regularly. Look for any signs of wear like flat spots, tears, or changes in shape. A cushion that's lost its ability to provide proper support won't protect you effectively, no matter how good it was when it was new. Most cushions need to be replaced every year or two, depending on use, but check with your healthcare provider or equipment supplier for recommendations specific to your cushion type.

Proper placement and positioning make a big difference. Make sure your cushion is centered on your wheelchair seat, with the back edge against the backrest. Sit fully on the cushion rather than perching on the edge, and make sure your clothing is smooth underneath to avoid wrinkles that could create pressure points.

Keep your cushion clean according to the manufacturer's instructions. Many cushions have removable covers that can be washed. A clean cushion helps prevent skin irritation and extends the life of your equipment. Check your cushion regularly as part of your weekly routine, and don't hesitate to ask for help evaluating your cushion if you're unsure whether it's still providing adequate support.
