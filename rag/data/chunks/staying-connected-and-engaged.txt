Staying connected with others and engaged in activities you enjoy is important for your mental and emotional wellbeing. Social connections provide support, reduce feelings of loneliness, and can improve your overall quality of life.

Maintaining relationships with family and friends takes effort, but it's worth it. Regular phone calls, video chats, or visits help keep those connections strong. Even small interactions can make a difference - a quick text message or sharing a photo can help you feel connected even when you can't be together in person.

Finding activities and hobbies that you enjoy gives you something to look forward to and can provide a sense of purpose. This might include creative activities like drawing or music, reading, learning something new, volunteering, or participating in community groups or clubs that interest you.

Many communities have resources and groups specifically for people with disabilities, which can be great places to meet others who understand similar experiences. These might be social groups, advocacy organizations, or recreational programs. Balancing independence with accepting help when needed is also important - independence doesn't mean you have to do everything alone. Having support available when you need it actually helps you maintain your independence in other areas.
