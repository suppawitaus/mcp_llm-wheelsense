Hypertension, commonly called high blood pressure, occurs when the force of blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. Many people have high blood pressure without realizing it, as it often doesn't cause noticeable symptoms. This is why regular monitoring is important, especially as we age.

Most people with high blood pressure don't experience obvious symptoms. Some may notice occasional headaches, dizziness, or feeling lightheaded, particularly when changing positions. However, because these symptoms can have many causes, high blood pressure often goes undetected without regular monitoring. Many people discover they have it during routine healthcare visits.

For wheelchair users, high blood pressure can create some specific considerations. Dizziness or lightheadedness when changing positions, such as during transfers, can increase the risk of falls or loss of balance. Standing up quickly from a seated position, if you're able to stand, can cause dizziness. Even changing positions in your wheelchair, like moving from upright to reclined, can sometimes trigger dizziness.

Daily considerations include monitoring your blood pressure at home if your healthcare provider recommends it, making position changes gradually rather than quickly, staying well-hydrated, and being aware of how you feel when moving. If you experience frequent dizziness, especially during transfers, move slowly and ensure you have support. Regular blood pressure monitoring helps track your numbers. If you notice unusual symptoms like persistent headaches or frequent dizziness, or if you have questions about your blood pressure readings, discussing these with a healthcare professional can provide guidance.
