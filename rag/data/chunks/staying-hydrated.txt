Drinking enough water is important for everyone, and it's especially crucial when you use a wheelchair. Proper hydration helps your body function well, keeps your skin healthy, supports good digestion, and helps prevent problems like urinary tract infections.

Most people need about six to eight cups of fluids each day, though individual needs can vary. Water is best, but other fluids like herbal tea, milk, or diluted fruit juice also count toward your daily intake. Try to avoid too many sugary drinks, as they can cause other health issues.

How can you tell if you're getting enough? Some signs of dehydration include feeling thirsty, having dark yellow urine, feeling tired or lightheaded, dry mouth or skin, and going to the bathroom less frequently than usual. If you notice these signs, increase your fluid intake.

Many people find it helpful to keep a water bottle within easy reach in their wheelchair, or to set reminders on their phone to take drinks throughout the day. You can also include water-rich foods in your meals, like fruits, vegetables, and soups, which can contribute to your hydration. The key is making drinking water convenient and part of your regular routine.
