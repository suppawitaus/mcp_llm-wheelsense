Keeping your joints flexible through regular movement helps prevent stiffness and discomfort. Range of motion exercises are simple movements that take your joints through their full available movement, which is important for maintaining mobility and function.

When joints don't move regularly, they can become stiff and tight, making daily activities more difficult and sometimes uncomfortable. By moving your joints through their full range regularly, you're helping to maintain that flexibility and preventing problems before they start.

Simple range of motion exercises might include moving your arms in circles, flexing and extending your wrists and fingers, moving your head gently side to side and up and down, or any movements that take your joints through their comfortable range. You can do these exercises while sitting in your wheelchair, and they don't require any special equipment.

Try to do range of motion activities daily, ideally at the same time each day to build the habit. Some people prefer doing them in the morning to help wake up their body, while others find it helpful before bed to relax. Adapt movements to your individual needs and abilities - work within your comfortable range and don't push into pain. Even gentle movement helps, so find what works for you and stick with it regularly.
