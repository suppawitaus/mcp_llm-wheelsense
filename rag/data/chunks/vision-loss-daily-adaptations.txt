Vision loss refers to reduced ability to see clearly, which can range from mild blurriness to partial or complete blindness. This can develop gradually over time or occur more suddenly, and it can affect one or both eyes. Common causes include age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetic retinopathy. The impact on daily life depends on the type and severity of vision loss.

Symptoms include blurred or cloudy vision, difficulty seeing in low light or at night, loss of peripheral vision, seeing spots or floaters, difficulty reading or seeing details, trouble recognizing faces, and sometimes complete vision loss in one or both eyes. These changes can develop slowly, making them easy to miss initially, or they may occur more suddenly.

For wheelchair users with vision loss, daily life requires specific adaptations. Navigation becomes more challenging. Reading labels or important information becomes difficult. Safety concerns increase, as you may not see obstacles or potential hazards. Tasks that require visual precision, like medication management, become more challenging. You may need to rely more on assistance from others or adaptive techniques.

Daily considerations include ensuring good, consistent lighting throughout your living space, organizing your environment so items are always in predictable places, using large-print labels or markers for important items, asking for help reading important information, and using audio devices when helpful. Maintain regular eye exams, as early detection and treatment can sometimes prevent further vision loss. If you're experiencing vision changes, notice new symptoms, or need help adapting to vision loss, consulting with eye care professionals and low vision specialists can provide support and resources to help you maintain independence and safety.
