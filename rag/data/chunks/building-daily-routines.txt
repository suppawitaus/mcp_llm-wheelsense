Having consistent daily routines provides structure and can make it easier to incorporate healthy habits into your life. When activities become routine, they require less mental energy and decision-making, which can reduce stress and help you feel more organized.

Routines help you remember to do important things, like taking medications, doing skin checks, or staying hydrated. When these activities happen at the same time each day, they become automatic parts of your life rather than things you have to constantly remember.

Try to incorporate health practices into your daily routine. For example, you might do your skin check at the same time every day, perhaps right after getting dressed or before going to bed. You could pair pressure relief with checking the time on the hour, or do range of motion exercises while waiting for your morning coffee to brew.

Flexibility within structure is key - routines should support you, not make you feel trapped. It's okay if your routine needs to change sometimes due to appointments or unexpected situations. The goal is to have a general pattern that works most of the time, while being able to adapt when needed. Building habits gradually helps make them stick - start with one or two routines and add more over time. Celebrate small successes along the way, as every step toward building healthy routines is an accomplishment worth recognizing.
