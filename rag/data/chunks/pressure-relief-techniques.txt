Pressure relief techniques are simple movements you can do to take weight off areas that have been bearing pressure. These techniques are essential for preventing pressure sores and keeping your skin healthy.

One effective technique is the forward lean. Simply lean forward in your wheelchair, supporting yourself on your thighs or the armrests if needed, and hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds. This shifts weight off your tailbone and sitting bones, allowing blood flow to return to those areas.

Side-to-side weight shifts are another good option. Lean to one side, holding for 30 to 60 seconds, then lean to the other side. You can use the wheelchair armrests for support. This relieves pressure from one side while the other side takes the weight, then switches.

Many modern wheelchairs have tilt or recline features that can help with pressure relief. Using these features changes your body angle and can redistribute pressure effectively. If your wheelchair has these options, learn how to use them comfortably and incorporate them into your pressure relief routine.

The timing matters - aim to do pressure relief every 15 to 30 minutes when you're sitting. Many people find it helpful to pair pressure relief with other routine activities, like setting a phone reminder, or doing it during commercial breaks if watching TV. Making it easy to remember increases the chances you'll do it consistently.
