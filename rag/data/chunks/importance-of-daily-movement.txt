Regular physical activity offers numerous benefits for both your body and mind. When you move your body daily, you're doing something powerful for your overall health and wellbeing.

Physically, movement helps maintain flexibility in your joints, keeps your muscles strong, and improves circulation throughout your body. Better circulation means more oxygen and nutrients reach all parts of your body, including your skin, which can help with healing and overall tissue health. Strong muscles also help with daily activities like transferring in and out of your wheelchair.

Mentally, regular activity can boost your mood, reduce feelings of stress, and improve your energy levels. Many people find that moving their body helps them feel more capable and confident. Even small amounts of movement can make a noticeable difference in how you feel.

There are many types of activities suitable for wheelchair users. These might include wheelchair exercises, arm and shoulder movements, using resistance bands, or even activities like wheelchair basketball or swimming if accessible. The key is finding activities you enjoy and can do regularly. Start gradually and build consistency - even ten minutes a day is better than nothing. Over time, you can increase the duration and intensity as your strength and endurance improve.
