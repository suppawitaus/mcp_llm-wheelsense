Peripheral neuropathy refers to damage or dysfunction of nerves outside your brain and spinal cord, most commonly affecting nerves in your hands and feet. This nerve damage can cause various sensations and may affect your ability to feel normally. The condition can have many causes and affects people differently.

Symptoms typically include numbness or reduced sensation, tingling or "pins and needles" feelings, burning pain in affected areas, weakness in hands or feet, sensitivity to touch, and sometimes difficulty with coordination or balance. Symptoms often start gradually and may progress over time. Some people experience symptoms primarily in their feet, others in their hands, and some in both.

For wheelchair users, peripheral neuropathy creates specific concerns. Reduced hand sensation can affect your ability to feel and control your wheelchair properly, potentially impacting safety. Foot care becomes extremely important because reduced sensation means you might not feel injuries, pressure points, or temperature changes. You could burn your feet with hot water or develop sores without realizing it.

Daily considerations include performing regular, thorough inspections of your hands and feet since you may not feel problems developing, being cautious with temperature to avoid burns, protecting your hands and feet from injury, and being extra careful during transfers. It's important to look at your skin rather than relying on how it feels. If you notice new or worsening symptoms, any wounds or sores, or concerns about your ability to feel normally, discuss these with a healthcare professional who can help assess your nerve health and provide guidance for staying safe.
